# object-only-value
Assert that object has only one key and return its value.

For when you want to do `obj[Object.keys(obj)[0]]`, but know that if `obj`
somehow ended up with more keys than one, it'd end in a disaster.

Literally:

```js
```js

## Installation

```sh
npm install object-only-value
```

## Usage

```js
```
